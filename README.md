# Finished projects
## "Quick ducts"
Simple duct system compatible for most 5 inch racing drone making it possible to protect drones that were not directly purpose built for usage around people or fragile property :

# Projects still in the works
## Specific camera mount
I choose not to share this design as it is "original" enough that I want it to be absolutly finished before unveiling. It interfaces with the front support of all the following drones.

## Long Range foldable 4 inch
Most existing long range racing drones are 7 inch quadcopters. The aim of this project is to allow the drone to be smaller (around 4 inches), foldable and still perform for up to 20 minutes while carrying a lighter version of A 4K camera and a FPV system.

This project is in its final phases. Achieved 22 minutes flight time with a fully foldable frame. Flew at up to 90 km/h and to 5km distance without braking video signal.
It is currently tested as a fully 3D printed version and needs to be cut out of carbon fiber.

## Sub 250 grams cinewhoop
Making it possible to film up to 5K 60fps indoors under the limit of 250grams allows a drone operator to fly this drone whithout any necessary licence other than the 20 minute flight training required in the European Union. This cinewhoop is specifically designed to be as stable as possible. Its 2inch propellers mean it is able to fly throught tight gaps in an indoor environement.

This drone has been tuned and tested. It needs to fly at least more than a hundred hours in stable configuration to dub it "finished". It is currently tested as a fully 3D printed version and needs to be cut out of carbon fiber.

##Sub 250 grams "high performance" drone
In today filming industry a drone, specifically a "racing" drone is often used to film high speed high movement events, and as such the drones need to be high performance. This drone trades the stability and protection of the cinewhoop project for such a purpose.
