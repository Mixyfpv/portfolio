# Finished projects
## "Quick ducts"
Simple duct system compatible for most 5 inch racing drone making it possible to protect drones that were not directly purpose built for usage around people or fragile property :

# Projects still in the works
## Long Range foldable 4 inch
Most existing long range racing drones are 7 inch quadcopters. The aim of this project is to allow the drone to be smaller (around 4 inches), foldable and still perform for up to 20 minutes while carrying a lighter version of A 4K camera and a FPV system.

This project is in its final phases. Achieved 22 minutes flight time with a fully foldable frame. Flew at up to 90 km/h and to 5km distance without braking video signal.

## Sub 250 grams cinewhoop
Making it possible to film up to 5K 60fps indoors under the limit of 250grams allows a drone operator to fly this drone whithout any necessary licence other than the 20 minute flight training required in the European Union. This cinewhoop is specifically designed to be as stable as possible. Its 2inch propellers mean it is able to fly throught tight gaps in an indoor environment.

This drone has been tuned and tested. It needs to fly at least more than a hundred hours in stable configuration to dub it "finished".
